__Notes to Rafael:__

I like the sublime package `MarkdownEditing` is good for syntax highlighting. It can be installed using Package Control (CMD-SHIFT-P -> Install Packages --> MarkdownEditing).

When you have the time, please target the methods + results. The intro and discussion are a bit rough.


## TODO

- [ ] Add discussion of variance-time plots
- [ ] Work on figures
